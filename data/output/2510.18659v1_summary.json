  "summary": "The research paper \"Sherlock Your Queries: Learning to Ask the Right Questions for Dialogue-Based Retrieval\" by Dong Yun, Marco Schouten, and Dim Papadopoulos from the Technical University of Denmark addresses the challenge of ambiguous user queries in information retrieval systems. Traditional systems struggle with such queries due to their reliance on precise and comprehensive input, which is not always available from users. The paper proposes a novel dialogue-driven retrieval framework named SherlockLLM, which employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train an agent to generate a sequence of binary (yes/no) questions. This method aims to efficiently narrow down the search space by learning an optimal questioning strategy, thereby improving retrieval accuracy and reducing the number of interaction turns needed to identify the user's target.\n\nThe proposed framework is validated through a benchmark consisting of both structured and unstructured tasks, including two structured data retrieval games and an image retrieval task. The key results from the experimental evaluation demonstrate that SherlockLLM significantly outperforms strong baselines across all tasks. In structured tasks, its performance matches these baselines and approaches the theoretical optimal defined by binary search. For the unstructured task, the agent showcases its ability to learn a highly effective information-seeking dialogue policy, significantly outperforming the baselines.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper presents SherlockLLM as a robust and efficient solution for dialogue-based interactive retrieval systems. By leveraging reinforcement learning to train agents in asking the most informative questions, the framework addresses the challenge of ambiguous user queries, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of information retrieval. The authors also commit to releasing the code and models upon acceptance, facilitating further research and application of their work.",
