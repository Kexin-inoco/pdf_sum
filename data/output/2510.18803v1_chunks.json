This study addresses this need by analyzing 18 years (2005–2022) of \nresearch proposals funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC). \nWe conducted a comprehensive comparative evaluation of three topic modelling approaches: Latent \nDirichlet Allocation (LDA), Structural Topic Modelling (STM), and BERTopic. We also introduced a novel \nalgorithm, named COFFEE, designed to enable robust covariate effect estimation for BERTopic. This \nadvancement addresses a significant gap, as BERTopic lacks a native function for covariate analysis, unlike \nthe probabilistic STM. Our findings highlight that while all models effectively delineate core scientific \ndomains, BERTopic outperformed by consistently identifying more granular, coherent, and emergent \nthemes, such as the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence. Additionally, the covariate analysis, powered \nby COFFEE, confirmed distinct provincial research specializations and revealed consistent gender-based \nthematic patterns across various scientific disciplines. These insights offer a robust empirical foundation \nfor funding organizations to formulate more equitable and impactful funding strategies, thereby enhancing \nthe effectiveness of the scientific ecosystem.  \nKeywords: Research Investment, Research Trends, Large Language Models, Natural Language \nProcessing, Topic Modelling, COFFEE Algorithm",

As global investment in science and technology continues to \nincrease (Bloch and Sørensen 2014; Ebadi et al. 2020), there is a growing imperative for precise, \ndata-driven insights into research trends and funding dynamics. These insights are essential to \nensure that substantial investments translate into meaningful social and economic returns and \ncontribute to equitable resource allocation (Stephan 2012).\n\nWhile identifying which research initiatives are receiving funding is crucial, gaining a \ncomprehensive understanding of who conducts this research and where it takes place provides a \nmore holistic view (Bornmann, Mutz, and Daniel 2007; Urquhart‑Cronish, Otto, and Ogden 2019; \nWitteman et al. 2019). The existing literature highlights persistent gender and geographic \ndisparities in scientific funding and participation (Breschi and Lissoni 2010; Grillitsch, Fitjar, and \nStambøl 2019; Rodriguez-Pose et al. 2019). However, there is a critical gap in systematically \nquantifying how these researcher characteristics influence the prevalence of specific research \ntopics within large-scale funding datasets, and how these relationships might change over time, \npotentially reflecting systemic inequities or shifts in research priorities.",

      "content": "To effectively navigate and extract meaningful insights from extensive textual funding \ndatasets, in this work, we employ advanced computational techniques in Natural Language \nProcessing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Our focus is on topic modelling (TM), a \npowerful tool that enables uncovering the latent themes embedded within the corpus and \nsystematically tracking their evolution across demographic and temporal dimensions (Blei and \nLafferty 2006; Rosen-Zvi et al. 2004). Methodologically, first, we undertake a rigorous \ncomparative analysis of three prominent topic models: 1) Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei \n2003), which utilizes probabilistic inference to identify patterns in the data, 2) Structural Topic \nModelling (STM) (Roberts et al. 2013), which builds on LDA by incorporating document-level \ncovariates, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of thematic variations influenced by \nexternal factors, and 3) an advanced topic modelling approach based on Bidirectional Encoder \nRepresentations from Transformers (BERT), which leverages transformer-based contextual \nembeddings to capture semantic nuances (Devlin et al. 2019; Grootendorst 2020). This multi-\nmodel comparison is crucial as it enables us to assess how different underlying modelling \nassumptions, ranging from probabilistic inference in LDA and STM to semantic space analysis of \nthe BERT-based approach (Bianchi, Terragni, and Hovy 2021), affect the coherence of identified \ntopics and the interpretability of subsequent downstream analysis.\n\nNext, we conduct a comparative estimation of the quantitative influence of researcher \ncharacteristics, particularly gender and geographical locations, on the prevalence of different \nresearch topics in both the STM and BERTopic. To achieve this, we treat topic prevalence as a \ncontinuous outcome and apply robust regression-based effect estimation techniques. For the STM \nmodel, we use the established estimateEffect function of the stm package in R (Roberts, Stewart, \nand Tingley 2019), which is specifically designed to incorporate topic-model uncertainty through \nvariational posterior sampling. Recognizing that the BERTopic approach, by its nature, is not a \ngenerative probabilistic model and thus lacks native functions for direct effect estimation with \nintegrated uncertainty, in this work, we introduce a novel algorithm, the Covariate Effect \nEstimation for the BERTopic model (COFFEE), implemented in Python. This innovative \napproach emulates the STM framework by generating multiple bootstrapped topic distributions \nand subsequently applying Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression to robustly estimate the \neffects of demographic and geographic covariates. Although this strategy does not replicate the \nfull probabilistic machinery of STM, it critically enables meaningful methodological comparisons \nby capturing uncertainty through nonparametric resampling (Efron and Tibshirani 1994; Mooney \n1996) and aligning the structure of the statistical analysis across distinct modelling paradigms \n(Egger and Yu 2023).\n\nThis study is driven by two central research questions: First, what are the latent research \nthemes within the Canadian funding landscape from 2005 to 2022, and how have these themes \nevolved over time? Second, how do researcher characteristics, specifically gender and \ngeographical location, influence the prevalence of these identified research topics? By addressing \nthese questions, our work makes several significant contributions to the understanding of the \nCanadian STEM research ecosystem. We provide a comprehensive analysis of eighteen years of \npublicly available funded research proposals, employing three advanced topic modelling \ntechniques. The development of the novel COFFEE algorithm for BERTopic, combined with the \nuse of built-in effect estimate functionalities in STM, allows for a robust quantification of the",

This publicly \navailable dataset includes key features such as: Application ID, Application Title, First name and \nlast name of the Researcher, Organization, Province, Country, Competition Type, Award Amount, \nand Application summary.\n\nTo determine the gender of the researchers, we employed a multifaceted approach using the \nGPT-4 model (OpenAI Team et al. 2024). For each researcher, GPT-4 was prompted with the \nresearcher's first name, last name, and country of origin to classify the gender as “male”, “female”, \nor “ambiguous”. The prompt was carefully engineered to encourage GPT-4 to utilize its extensive \ntraining data, which includes implicit linguistic patterns (e.g., gendered name suffixes in various \nlanguages) and the regional prevalence of names. In instances where GPT-4 classified a name as \n“ambiguous”, we subsequently adopted the most frequently used gender associated with that name \nhistorically. For example, if “Taylor” was historically more commonly associated with males, it \nwas classified as male in our dataset.\n\nTo ensure the accuracy of our gender classifications, we conducted a thorough validation \nprocess.

      "content": "BERTopic consistently exhibited a superior ability to decompose broad subjects into multiple, \nhighly specialized, and semantically rich topics. This enhanced granularity allows for a detailed \nand nuanced understanding of a domain, as it resolves distinct facets that other models might blend \ninto broader categories. The contextual nature of its embeddings enables BERTopic to grasp subtle \nsemantic relationships, resulting in more insightful and coherent topic definitions and providing \nuniquely nuanced semantic discovery. STM generally provided a good balance between \nidentifying broad, well-established themes and reasonably distinct sub-topics. Its unique topics are \ncoherent and well-defined, indicating a solid capability to identify meaningful clusters. It serves \nas a robust option when a moderate level of thematic granularity is desired. Conversely, LDA, \nwhile effective at identifying main thematic currents and demonstrating good topic diversity, \nconsistently produced more generalized topics. Its probabilistic nature, relying on word co-\noccurrence, often results in less specific or insightful topics for dissecting niche research areas, \nmaking it less effective for very fine-grained thematic analysis. Collectively, this research offers \nmethodological guidance for selecting appropriate topic modelling approaches based on desired \nanalytical granularity. While all models robustly identify prominent scientific domains, BERTopic \nexcels in uncovering more granular, highly specific, and often novel themes.\n\nAnother key contribution of this work is the development and application of the COFFEE \nalgorithm. This novel bootstrap-based pipeline addresses the inferential limitations of non-\nprobabilistic topic models, enabling robust statistical analysis of covariate effects. By pairing \nCOFFEE with BERTopic and comparing the results to STM's established estimateEffect function, \nwe validated our approach by corroborating known research specializations. For instance, both \nframeworks identified Alberta's leadership in “Environmental Science & Industrial Processes” and \nthe prominence of “Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence” in Ontario and British Columbia. \nOur findings highlighted the superior analytical resolution of the COFFEE-powered BERTopic \neffect estimate approach. It uncovered unique, statistically significant regional niches that were \ninvisible to STM. For example, BERTopic uniquely detected a significant research focus on \n“Environmental Science” in Newfoundland and Labrador and on “Materials Science & Applied \nPhysics” in New Brunswick. The analysis of gender effects was equally revealing. While both \nmodels confirmed the well-documented underrepresentation of women in “Computer Science & \nAI”, COFFEE uniquely identified “Public Health & Vaccine Communication” as a field with a \nsignificant positive association with female researchers. This finding is particularly potent, as STM \ncould not even test this relationship, having failed to identify the topic in the first place.\n\nThese findings have significant implications for science policy. By providing a more granular \nand sensitive analytical tool, the COFFEE-powered BERTopic framework allows funding \nagencies such as NSERC to move beyond high-level summaries toward a more nuanced \nunderstanding of the research landscape. Such precision is vital for developing targeted, evidence-\nbased strategies that support regional research ecosystems and promote the goals of Equity, \nDiversity, and Inclusion (EDI).",

Future studies could explore the \nimpact of different preprocessing techniques to assess their influence on model outcomes. Second, \nthe choice of the 0.82 cosine similarity threshold for defining topic similarity between models is a \nhyperparameter. This threshold was determined through an iterative qualitative assessment to \noptimize meaningful thematic correspondences. However, selecting a different threshold could \nalter the categorization of topics. Further research could examine the effects of varying this \nparameter and develop methods for dynamically adjusting it based on dataset characteristics. \nThird, the interpretation and labelling of topics, initially generated using the GPT-4o model and \nrefined through human review, are inherently subjective. Despite efforts to mitigate bias, different \nhuman interpretations and potential biases in large language models should be considered. \nDeveloping more objective and automated methods for topic interpretation could enhance \nreliability. Methodologically, further investigation into robust, model-integrated covariate effect \nestimation techniques for embedding-based topic models is warranted to reduce reliance on post-\nhoc bootstrapping. Such advancements would improve the precision and reliability of effect \nestimation in embedding-based models, e.g., BERTopic. Substantively, future work could expand \nthe dataset to include research proposals funded by other organizations, such as Canadian Tri-\nAgencies (Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), Social Sciences and Humanities \nResearch Council of Canada (SSHRC)). This would provide a more comprehensive view of the \nnational research ecosystem. Additionally, a deeper exploration of the underlying factors driving \nprovincial and gender-based specializations, potentially integrating additional demographic \nvariables or historical policy analyses, would offer valuable context.
