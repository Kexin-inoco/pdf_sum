Traditional\nmonitoring approaches, such as manual water sampling, remain labor-intensive\nand limited in spatial and temporal coverage. Recent advances in vision-language\nmodels (VLMs) for remote sensing have shown potential for scalable AI-driven\nsolutions, yet challenges remain in reasoning over imagery and quantifying bloom\nseverity. In this work, we introduce ALGae Observation and Segmentation (AL-\nGOS), a segmentation-and-reasoning system for HAB monitoring that combines\nremote sensing image understanding with severity estimation.

All experiments were conducted on eight NVIDIA DGX A100 GPUs\n(80GB each). For severity prediction, we fine-tuned LLaVA-7B with LoRA for 50 epochs on the\nHAB dataset. For segmentation, ALGOS was trained jointly on HAB, FP-Ref-COCO [19], and\nReasonSeg [9]. LoRA [7] was applied to the multimodal language model, while the SAM decoder\nwas fully fine-tuned. The learning rate was set to 3 × 10−4, with other configurations kept consistent\nwith standard practice. For the composite loss, we set the weighting coefficients to ωtxt = 1.0 and\nωmask = 1.0. Within the segmentation objective, the per-pixel binary cross-entropy and DICE terms\nare weighted as ωbce = 2.0 and ωdice = 0.5, respectively. Empirically, this configuration yielded the\nbest overall performance. Training required approximately 6 hours across eight DGX A100 GPUs.\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nSetup\n\nPerformance metrics. Following Lai et al. [9], Quenum et al. [15], we evaluate segmentation\nusing two IoU variants under a binary setting (algae vs. non-algae). The cIoU metric computes the\nper-image, class-balanced mean IoU; with only one foreground class, this reduces to the average\nIoU of algae masks across images (assigning a score of 1 when both prediction and ground truth are\nempty, and 0 otherwise). The gIoU metric instead aggregates intersections and unions across all test\nimages before computing the ratio. In the binary case, this measures agreement with the total algae\nextent over the full test set, making it more sensitive to prevalence and large contiguous blooms. For\nthe severity prediction task, we use mean squared error (MSE) as the primary metric, reflecting the\nordinal nature of severity levels.\n\nBaselines. Table 1 compares ALGOS with state-of-the-art reasoning segmentation models [9, 15],\nwhile Table 2 benchmarks ALGOS against LLaVA [11].\n\n4.2\nResults and Observations\n\nALGOS achieves strong performance across both segmentation and severity prediction tasks. For\nsegmentation, it reaches a cIoU of 0.65 and gIoU of 0.60, far surpassing LISAT (0.11 / 0.10) and\nLISA-7B (0.14 / 0.13), accurately capturing both per-image bloom regions and large contiguous\nextents across the dataset (Table 1). For severity prediction, ALGOS substantially reduces error, with\nmean squared error (MSE) dropping from 3.868 to 2.984, along with corresponding improvements in\nRMSE and MAE (Table 2). These results show that ALGOS is capable of addressing both spatial\nsegmentation and severity-level estimation, while outperforming baselines in each task.\n\n5\nConclusion\n\nWe introduced ALGae Observation and Segmentation, a framework that leverages multimodal\nlanguage models to reason over heterogeneous data and dynamically segment harmful algal bloom\n\n4",
