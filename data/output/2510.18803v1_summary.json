  "summary": "This research paper, authored by Shirin Tavakoli Kafiabad, Andrea Schiffauerova, and Ashkan Ebadi, delves into optimizing national scientific investments by understanding the dynamics of research trends, with a focus on the impact of gender and geographic location. The study analyzes 18 years (2005â€“2022) of research proposals funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) using three topic modeling approaches: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Structural Topic Modeling (STM), and BERTopic. A novel algorithm named COFFEE was introduced to enhance BERTopic's capability for robust covariate effect estimation, addressing its lack of native function for such analysis.\n\nThe key findings from the comparative evaluation show that BERTopic outperforms LDA and STM in identifying more detailed and coherent research themes, notably highlighting the significant growth of artificial intelligence as a research area. The COFFEE algorithm facilitated the uncovering of distinct provincial research specializations and consistent gender-based thematic patterns, offering insights into the demographic and geographical influences on scientific research funding.\n\nThe study concludes that the insights gained from the comparative analysis and covariate effects can guide funding organizations in developing more equitable and impactful funding strategies, thereby improving the overall effectiveness of the scientific ecosystem. Despite its contributions, the paper acknowledges limitations related to the preprocessing step of topic modeling and suggests areas for future research to further refine and expand upon the findings.",
